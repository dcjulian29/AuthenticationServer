Authentication Server
=============

This project contains an implementation of Identity Server V3 which will be responsible for providing access tokens to any authorized applications that need a single-sign on solution. The initial implementation will have in-memory users but can be changed later to use users/passwords from other sources such as SQL DB and Active Directory.
